Hi I like to program and like retro computers and consoles.
I like the nes snes and gameboy family the most.

If you want to reach me please send an email to 
numaticjoemailbox@gmail.com

My projects are done induvidually so don't expect a collaboration 
The reason for this is so I can work on it when I want to. I also find it easier.
I'm not employed I just like making programs.

I'm from the UK so my time zone might be different to yours so I might reply to an email at a later time. 

I want to make an emulator but don't know how.


Have a nice day! :) 

Thanks
