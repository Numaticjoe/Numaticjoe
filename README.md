Hi I like networking c# visual studio program writing and hardware
I use Visual studio 2022 Community as my IDE.

If you want to reach me please send an email to 
numaticjoemailbox@gmail.com

My projects are done induvidually so don't expect a collaboration 
The reason for this is so I can work on it when I want to. I also find it easier. 

I'm from the UK so my time zone might be different to yours so I might reply to an email at a later time. 

I am currently thinking of a program to make I might make a notepad web browser or something. 
One day I am planning on making a home brew nes or game boy applications 
I also really wanna make a nes emulator. 

Have a nice day! :) 

Thanks
