Hi I like networking c# visual studio program writing and hardware
I use Visual studio 2022 Community as my IDE.

If you want to reach me please send an email to 
numaticjoemailbox@gmail.com

My projects are done induvidually so don't expect a collaboration 
The reason for this is so I can work on it when I want to. I also find it easier. 

I'm from the UK so my time zone might be different to yours so I might reply to an email at a later time. 

I am currently thinking of a program to make. This is why so many projects have been cancelled. 
I want to make a file manager and an nes emulator. 
Hopefully one of these projects will come as soon as I get my pc back to windows 10 from 11


Have a nice day! :) 

Thanks
